## Kadie's Subject Pool Management System

A web application suited to organization of student and course records and related documents
for the purposes of academic research projects.

To get started, run an instance of `mongod` and point it at the application's `data` folder. Then run

    npm start

and navigate to `localhost:27017` (or whatever is configured in `config/default.json`).

Please report bugs!

Thanks,
Lucas
