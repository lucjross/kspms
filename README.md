## Kadie's Subject Pool Management System

A web application suited to organization of student and course records and related documents
for the purposes of academic research projects.

To get started, you will need to have installed git (https://git-scm.com/),
MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.org/),
node.js (https://nodejs.org/),
npm (https://www.npmjs.com/),
git (https://git-scm.com/)...
Am I leaving anything out?

Paths should be configured for these components as necessary.

Start the MongoDB daemon (`<mongo-path>/bin/mongod --dbpath <wherever>`).

Then run

    npm install
    npm start

and navigate to `localhost:3000`.

Please report bugs!

Thanks,

Lucas
